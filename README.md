# FAQ:
## General
### Can you implement **[feature]**?
Give it a shot yourself or (siri-chan.github.io/elsewhere)[contact me.] I'm open to suggestions.
### Why didn't you use **[code]** to write **[feature]**?
I have no clue what i'm doing lol
### Why can't I use this on **[Operating System]**?
You probably can. I just haven't tested it. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build)[See the page for `dotnet build` for more information.]
## -z/-uz
### Why can't I use -z and -uz?
Windows doesn't have `sudo`. You could probably use a linux shell, or manually run it as an admin via a compatibility setting, but that isn't my field of expertise, and I have never tested it.
### Why don't you remove -z and -uz?
I might make them work properly in the future. I have been considering building a seperate exe that has the above listed compatibility settings, or a built-in admin thing, to make UAC work properly.
